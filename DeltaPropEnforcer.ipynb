It ensures changes are applied without risking data loss, supports previews (dry-runs), skips tables with ongoing writes to prevent conflicts, and provides full rollback capability.\n","\n","- **Why dry-runs?** A dry-run simulates changes without actually applying them. This lets you preview what would happen (e.g., which properties would change) to avoid mistakes in production.\n","- **Why skip if something is writing to a table?** If a table is being modified (e.g., by another process inserting data), altering its properties could cause conflicts or corruption. Skipping ensures safety; you can retry later.\n","- **Why rollback?** Changes might have unintended effects (e.g., performance issues). Rollback reverts to the previous state using backups, providing a safety net.\n","- **Why wait to check if successful?** Metadata changes (like table properties) might not reflect immediately due to system delays or caching. Waiting and polling ensures the change was applied correctly before proceeding.\n","- **Why and where save log files?** Logs record every action for auditing, debugging, and compliance. They are saved persistently in each lakehouse under `Files/logs/` (a folder in the lakehouse storage) so they survive notebook sessions and are organized per lakehouse for easy access.\n"],"metadata":{},"id":"5eeda445-39e9-472a-b910-6725956b3393"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# We need semantic link to scan workspaces to find all lakehouses for batch ALTER\n","%pip install semantic-link-labs"],"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"editable":true,"run_control":{"frozen":false}},"id":"e75f7653-2a10-4f89-a56e-92a655f63856"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Import required libraries: sempy_labs for Fabric interactions, datetime for timestamps, etc.\n","import sempy_labs as labs\n","import sempy.fabric as fabric\n","import urllib.parse\n","from datetime import datetime\n","from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed\n","import time\n","import logging\n","from functools import wraps\n","import io\n","from threading import Lock\n","from delta.tables import DeltaTable\n","\n","# === SILENCE CHATTY LIBRARIES ===\n","# Set logging levels to WARNING to reduce unnecessary output from libraries like azure and msal.\n","logging.getLogger(\"azure\").setLevel(logging.WARNING)\n","logging.getLogger(\"sempy\").setLevel(logging.WARNING)\n","logging.getLogger(\"msal\").setLevel(logging.WARNING)\n","logging.getLogger(\"urllib3\").setLevel(logging.WARNING)\n","\n","print(\"Libraries loaded.
